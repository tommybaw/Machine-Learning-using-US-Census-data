# US-Census

The purpose of this project is to identify key social/economic factors that are statistically proven to have strong influence on an individualâ€™s level of income. The task is to build predictive models which determine whether or not a person makes more than $50,000 per year. While the predictive algorithm will be the main focus of the work, we will also use data visualization and correlation analysis to take a look at other potential correlations, such as ethnicity to education levels, and gender to income, to extract further information beyond the predictive models.
